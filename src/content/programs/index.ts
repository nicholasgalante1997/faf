## Spotlight Program

### Empowering Through Online Community and Guidance Through Other's Experiences

Not everyone has the capacity to devote time in a mentor/mentee relationship, but would still like to support and make a meaningful difference through sharing their stories of overcoming hardships, and arriving at the other side of their struggles.

These accounts are inherently valuable because they offer us a window into how other's have perservered and which tactics they've deployed to do so.

This program allows us to cicrulate **Spotlight Stories** about individuals within our community who have an astounding story of how the hardships in their lives have later led to their greatest successes and how we can all grow through adversity.

- **Releases:** BiWeekly releases of new Spotlight Stories
- **Success Rate:** Over 450+ individuals subscribed to **Spotlight Stories** newsletter.
- **Join the Newsletter:** [Become engaged with our Spotlight Stories community week over week](/spotlight-stories/subscribe)
