I am a student at Penngate University studying Health Policy and Administration and minoring in Labor and Human Resources. I am from Long Island, NY. In high school and throughout my childhood years, I played soccer on an outside team and continue to enjoy playing non-competitively in college. In my free time, I love to draw because it helps me to be able to relax and take time out of my day to destress.

I was born in Manhasset which is located closer to city on Long Island. I did move at a very early age from a different town due to housing issues but am so fortunate to have been able to grow up in such a beautiful place surrounding by welcoming people.

I wanted to become a mentor because being able to help others guide through day to day issues and be an extra hand that people can count on is something I always strive for. Since an early age of mine, I always felt like there was something missing in my life, someone that I can count on and be able to have to talk to about everything.

Of course, I have great parents and a great group of friends, but I still felt like I just was never able to fully open up around them. I always felt like I had so much to want to say to people and words to express but when the time came where I was in front of them, it just felt like it all disappeared.

Fortunately, when I got to college, I found my forever best friend who I was able to feel comfortable enough right away to open up to and be able to talk about anything. Finding someone to help navigate your emotions has significantly helped me out in such a positive way and I want others to feel that too.

My friends at school not only mentored me, but guided me through such hard times and tricky obstacles I had to face throughout the year. They helped me to realize that regrets or mistakes I have caused in the past were just learning lessons to better myself in the future. I was able to use their advice to grow as a person and to my full potential.

My main goal as part of this team, is to create a difference, even in just one humans life, where they feel they are heard. I want them to feel like someone does care about them even if they don't think so, just how I felt. That someone understand how they deeply feel and that there is always a way to fix it.

Of course, it takes time to build trust with people, but I believe that anyone is able to connect with each other if work is put in on both ends.

Every May, I volunteer at a meaningful charity event called **Sounds of Silence**, a 5K run dedicated to raising awareness and funds for postpartum depression. I chose to be part of this team because I'm inspired by the mission and dedication of those around me who share the same drive to make a difference.

Being surrounded by individuals who are deeply committed to supporting this cause motivates me to keep pushing forward each year. While it's heartbreaking to meet families who have lost loved ones to postpartum depression, their stories fuel my determination. They remind me why this work matters and why it's so important to continue raising funds, awareness, and hope for prevention and healing.

Through my experiences with mental health challenges and finding support, I've learned that sometimes the most powerful thing we can do is simply listen. Everyone deserves to feel heard, understood, and supported—regardless of what they're going through.

As I continue my studies in Health Policy and Administration, I'm committed to using my education and personal experiences to create systemic change in how we approach mental health support, particularly for young adults navigating college life and beyond.

*If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health challenges, remember: you are not alone, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.*

I am a student studying environmental studies at Binghamton university. I am from Saratoga Springs upstate NY. In high school I did theatre and tennis, I still have an interest in the performing arts and love going to see shows. I also love movies more than anything and have been looking for a career combining sustainability in filmmaking! Some of my hobbies include crocheting, hiking, and going to thrift stores, garage sales etc. I also love spending time with friends and family because I believe social interaction is a necessity for all humans.

I chose to become a mentor because I am extremely passionate about mental health awareness in particular. Communication is extremely valuable to everyone's mental state and I wish to help make people realize that their thoughts, problems, and diagnoses are completely separate from their overall identity. I have struggled with mental health in the past and have come a long way from where I started. I really believe I can help make a difference in others lives purely through proper discussion and open communication.

One problem I recently overcame was going off of my medication. I have struggled with anxiety for over 2 years and have been on medication to help suppress the negative thoughts. Although, the medication did not work for me, and I believed it was creating more wrong in my life than positives. I decided to ween off of the meds. This was an extremely difficult process for me because the particular medication I was on had severe withdrawal side effects. I looked at it as a challenge and was able to get through it. I now have no side effects and am so proud of myself for sticking with it.

My main goal is to help individuals of any age, separate their negative thoughts from their reality. My method is honesty. Being honest with yourself and the world around you means being vulnerable. Being vulnerable can be scary, but can also be the solution to so many problems. I hope to extend this way of thought to as many people as possible.

I enjoy volunteering especially when it has to do with the environment. A happy earth means happy people. This means picking up trash/litter whenever and wherever I see it. I also like to practice sustainable habits at home such electricity and water conservation practices.

I want to let everyone know that talking things out can have a tremendous impact on your life through transparency, honesty, and vulnerability. I would love to help everyone see this come to action in their own lives.

My name is Andrew Potestivo, and I am 19 years old, originally from Staten Island, New York. I am currently pursuing a degree in Systems Science and Industrial Engineering at Binghamton University, a discipline that combines analytical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. Growing up in a dynamic and diverse environment has significantly influenced my academic interests and shaped my commitment to pursuing meaningful, impactful work.

I am the youngest of six children, which meant I was constantly surrounded by different personalities and perspectives. Losing my grandparents at a young age was difficult, but it also brought my immediate family closer together. Being the youngest taught me how to observe, listen, and learn from those around me—skills that I've carried into both academic and social settings.

From a young age, I was fascinated by architecture and design. Interestingly, much of that curiosity was sparked through video games, where I spent hours building and experimenting with structure and layout. That creative interest eventually evolved into a passion for problem-solving and systems thinking, laying the foundation for my pursuit of engineering.

Outside of academics, baseball has always been a major part of my life. It taught me the value of teamwork, patience, and communication. While I was definitely a very studious student throughout high school, I've always believed that learning isn't just about textbooks. The ability to engage with others, exchange ideas, and collaborate has always felt just as important—if not more—than anything taught in a classroom.

My interest in engineering was also influenced by my family. My dad works as a carpenter, and watching him create tangible, lasting things with his hands inspired me to pursue a path where I could also build and innovate. My older brother, who is now a mechanical engineer, has also been a huge influence and role model. Their examples helped me realize that engineering is not just about math and science—it's about creativity, purpose, and impact.

Growing up, my parents were definitely strict, especially when it came to respect, discipline, and honesty. But even with their structure, they've always given me the freedom to make my own decisions. Whether it was about school, personal challenges, or pursuing baseball, I've always felt their support. That balance between high expectations and unwavering encouragement shaped who I am today and gave me the confidence to follow my own path.

I became a mentor because I've always believed that the most important part of learning is connection—whether it's through teamwork, conversation, or simply being present for someone else. Growth doesn't happen in isolation. It comes from sharing experiences, exchanging ideas, and learning how to support one another. I wanted to be the kind of person who others could lean on, not just for academic help, but for encouragement, friendship, and honest advice. By mentoring, I hope to help others realize that building each other up is just as valuable as building knowledge.

A major source of inspiration for me has been the people in my life who are fighting—or have fought—cancer. My dad is currently going through that battle, and witnessing his strength has changed my perspective on what support really means. I think about how difficult that fight would be if he had to go through it alone, and it reminds me that no one should ever have to face hard things by themselves. Everyone deserves to have someone in their corner, and that's exactly the kind of presence I hope to be for others—whether they're struggling with school, confidence, or something much deeper.

I've been lucky to have several mentors throughout my life, many of whom are in my own family. My older brother became a mechanical engineer while I was still in high school, and watching him go through that journey definitely sparked my interest in the field. Seeing how passionate he was about solving problems and creating real-world solutions made me want to explore that same path for myself. He's always been someone I look up to—not just academically, but in how he carries himself and supports others.

My dad has also played a major role in shaping my confidence and mindset. He's always been the type of person to fix things around the house, build projects from scratch, and solve problems with his hands. That kind of resourcefulness rubbed off on me early. I started to see challenges not as roadblocks, but as opportunities to figure things out on my own. His work ethic and ability to make things better—no matter how small—taught me that I'm capable of more than I think, as long as I'm willing to try.

Even outside of real-life role models, I've found inspiration in unexpected places—like video games. Playing games that let me build, create, and problem-solve opened my eyes to the possibilities of what I could accomplish with the right mindset and tools. It may sound simple, but the sense of accomplishment I felt in those virtual spaces made me start thinking seriously about what I could achieve in the real world. That motivation, combined with the support and example set by my family, has helped push me forward in both my education and personal development.

One of the biggest challenges I've faced was adjusting to college life—specifically the academic expectations. There's a common misconception that doing well in middle and high school automatically prepares you for college, but that's not always the case. In high school, I was able to succeed by showing up, completing assignments, and putting in consistent effort. I graduated in the top 10% of a class of nearly 1,000 students, so I assumed I was fully prepared for the next step. But once I started college, I quickly realized that success here required a much higher level of independence and personal accountability.

In college, simply doing the assigned work and attending class isn't enough. It's up to you to stay organized, manage your time, and go beyond what's expected in order to truly understand the material. That shift was a tough adjustment for me, and I found myself struggling to keep up at first. But through that experience, I learned how to study more efficiently, how to teach myself new concepts, and how to adapt quickly when things got difficult. That growth has carried over into other parts of my life too, helping me become a more self-motivated and resourceful person in everything I do.

My main goal in this program is to be a source of support and guidance for those who are facing difficult and relentless situations. Life is full of unexpected challenges, and I believe that learning how to navigate those challenges—whether through resilience, perspective, or simply having someone to talk to—can lead to personal growth both in and out of the classroom. I want to be someone that others can rely on during tough times, especially those who may feel like they have no one else in their corner.

At the same time, I see this as an opportunity for my own growth. I want to become someone who can lead with empathy and communicate effectively in a mentorship role. I plan to do that by truly listening to the people I work with and learning from their stories, experiences, and perspectives. Mentorship isn't a one-way street—it's a relationship built on trust, shared growth, and mutual learning. I hope to leave this program not only having helped others, but also having become a stronger, more thoughtful version of myself.

I currently give back to my community by assisting elderly residents who need help with daily tasks. I spend around 12 to 15 hours each week in their homes, helping with things like preparing meals, getting around, or simply offering company. It's something I genuinely enjoy—not just because I'm able to help, but because of what I've gained from the experience. The older generations have so much wisdom to share, and a lot of the time, no one takes the time to listen. Their stories, life lessons, and advice have taught me a lot about patience, humility, and perspective.

Outside of academics, I feel deeply connected through the relationships I've built during my time at school. Whether it's my fraternity brothers or my girlfriend, who I met at Binghamton, the people in my life outside the classroom have had a huge impact on me. Daily conversations, shared struggles, and personal growth through these relationships have helped me feel grounded and supported.

What really drives me to stay involved—both in my community and in my personal life—are the people I care about. I'm incredibly grateful for the strong relationships I've built with my family, friends, and mentors, and I carry that gratitude into everything I do. I want to be successful not just for myself, but so I can give back to the people who have been there for me and make them proud. That motivation is what keeps me pushing forward.

I am a student at SUNY Geneseo and studying marketing. I am from Long Island, NY. I have played tennis and badminton my whole entire life and have recently retired. I went to Commack high school and have lived in Commack, NY my whole entire life. I was born in Manhasset, NY.

High school was a rocky place for me in the beginning, adjusting to the new place and especially since it was during covid that made things harder. I was slowly feeling more alone each day until I met my friends who took me in and helped me feel loved. The reason why I became a mentor was because I want to help people feel loved and feel like they belong here. Being able to help people and being that person that they can count on is an amazing opportunity. I want to help people with anything through their issues or just to have a daily conversation. I've always wanted a person who I can count on. My family are amazing people but due to my parents growing up in South Korea and immigrating to the US it was hard due to communication and the cultural differences ,we didn't get along very well when I was in high school. My brother is five years older than me which is a pretty big age gap, we also never really have gotten along in high school due to the different maturity levels. I've had a close friend group who later on decided to leave me for other friends. There were many times where I felt alone and it's not a good feeling to have. I have battled with the idea of feeling alone for a long time but I can finally say where I don't feel that anymore. I want to help other people fight the feeling of being alone.

There are many people who have mentored me. Even though my family didn't get along in the beginning, throughout my life they have taught me so many life lessons and how to be as a person. They have helped me through a lot and have supported me. My friends at school and from home have also been the best mentors. They have helped me fight the feeling of being alone and have been an amazing support system. I am very grateful for them. Another person who has mentored me is my boyfriend. He has supported me at every single low in my life and has been there for me everyday.

My main goal as part of the team is to help and create a difference. I want people to feel heard and loved. I want someone to feel like they have a shoulder to lean on and they have someone they can trust. I almost lost someone due to the feeling of being alone and it was hard but that is why my main goal is to support and be there for the people who may feel like this. I hope to create a difference and create a safe space that people can go to me for.

I volunteer at my church whenever I am home and being a part of a sorority has given me so many opportunities to give back to the community. Being able to give back and help makes me feel alive. I love being able to help whenever help is needed.

    content: `Hi! My name is Austin, I'm 20 years old, I am a biology/pre-PA major at Binghamton University, and I'm from Dobbs Ferry, New York. For a while now, I've always tried to be someone who kept it together, someone who looked fine on the outside. But underneath I was struggling with something much heavier. I didn't just dislike the way I looked, I hated the person I saw in the mirror. Every glance felt like a reminder of everything I wasn't: not good enough, not strong enough, not worth it. I felt an unbearable amount of shame, disgust, and emptiness. I didn't see someone who just needed time to grow, I saw someone I wanted to escape, not someone I wanted to fix. I've struggled with major depression and deep self-hate. And I don't mean just feeling sad or having a bad day, I mean waking up every day and wondering if things would ever feel different. I mean carrying emotions that felt too heavy to say out loud. There were nights I didn't know who I was becoming, and days I couldn't tell anyone because I didn't want them to look at me the way I looked at myself. Growing up, I didn't really have people or places where it felt okay to talk about deep emotions. Pain, fear, sadness. Those things stayed buried, because I didn't know how to share them and didn't think anyone really wanted to hear them. So when I started dealing with depression, I had no idea how to handle it. I smiled when I needed to. But inside, it was chaos and I didn't know how to ask for help. I became a mentor because I know how terrifying it is to feel like you're alone with your pain. I've lived through moments when my foundation shattered, when I disconnected from my purpose, and when I started losing pieces of myself. I watched the version of me I wanted to become slip away, not because I stopped caring but because I didn't know how to come back from everything I had lost. It's hard to look in the mirror when the mirror itself feels broken. When all you see is the damage. The failure. The version of you no one else sees, the one you've been silently at war with. But I've learned something over time: even when the mirror is cracked, you can still rebuild your reflection. You can still learn to see something worth loving. The hardest thing I've had to overcome is learning how to love the parts of my story I never wanted to happen. The nights I wish I could erase. The mistakes that cost me people I cared about. The fear that maybe I really wasn't enough. What made it even harder was knowing how avoidable some of those mistakes were, how just one different decision could've changed everything. That kind of regret eats at you. It made forgiving myself feel impossible, because the truth is that I knew better. But through it all, I kept showing up. Not because I felt strong, but because something in me refused to give up. I wanted to believe that even if I couldn't love myself yet, maybe one day I could. And over time, I've started to understand what it really means to love the parts of my story I once wanted to erase. Those moments, the ones that broke me, that I thought I'd never recover from also became the ones that changed me the most. They forced me to confront who I was, and gave me the chance to become someone I never would've met otherwise. I don't love the pain for what it took from me, I love it for what it revealed in me. For how it taught me to listen. To feel. To care more deeply. To choose who I want to be, not just react to who I was. That's what healing really is: not pretending it never hurt, but realizing the hurt didn't get the final word. I've had people show me grace when I couldn't offer it to myself. They didn't try to fix me, they just stood by me, and that changed everything. Now I want to be that for someone else. If I can sit with someone in their pain, help them hold it, and remind them that they're not broken beyond repair, then all of this will have meant something. Outside of this, I'm passionate about lifting, being active, hanging out with friends, watching movies and finding peace with myself, not because I've reached some final version of who I want to be, but because I'm learning to honor who I am right now. If there's one thing I want you to take from this, i want you to know that even if you hate yourself right now, even if you feel like no one could ever love who you are, I promise you that you are still worthy of love. Especially from yourself. You're not too far gone. You're not weak for hurting. You're not alone. And you are not done.`,

Hi guys! I'm Caila Abou-Saab, and I'm 21 years old from Carle Place, New York, but I originally grew up in Jericho, New York. I go to Binghamton University, where I joined groups and met so many amazing individuals. These people, including my lovely home friends and family, have seen me at my highest, and my lowest points, and without them, I would not have that emotional support to help me navigate through something that is yet somewhat common, but still heart wrenching to have to deal with, especially having to deal with it at a young age, in an area that is not the friendliest, and then having to deal with it for the rest of your life.

In 2014, on a chilly October afternoon, my father started to notice my hair was very thin at the top of my head, which was very unusual because I've always had thick, long hair. He instantly booked a dermatologist appointment for the next week. When that day came, the thinning got worse. The doctor examined my head and left the room for about 30 minutes. My father and I sat anxiously waiting for an answer, hoping it was nothing. Finally, the doctor came back and told my father, "Your daughter has alopecia areata." He explained that it is not a life-threatening disease, nor is it a disease that will make me physically ill, but it is an autoimmune disease that has no cure. My 10-year-old self was oblivious, as I had no idea what any of the terminology meant, so I just let the adults speak. I didn't understand anything that day. I didn't understand even a week later, but as I had to deal with this for the next months, and even years, I started to understand it more, and each time I would get a better idea about what this autoimmune disease consisted of, it just kept on getting more depressing. Each and every new realization came with a new, inevitable wave of sadness, fear, and frustration.

It is quite mind-boggling that something as simple as your hair can hold so much of your identity. We don't realize it until it starts slipping away slowly, strand by strand. It's not about the cosmetic aspect of it; it's about losing that sense of control, familiarity, and having to adapt to it in ways that no one prepares you for. Although people may not notice, you not being able to recognize yourself is just as bad as it unravels deeper fears within you. Alopecia Areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease where the immune system mistakenly attacks the hair follicles because it thinks something foreign has entered the body. When that happens, the typical response would be with increased hair shedding or bald patches, typically most seen on the scalp, but it can affect anywhere on the body, including eyebrows and eyelashes. The thought of this sneaking up on you anytime is devastating. Once one starts to form, it is very difficult to halt it. You just have to let it go through its life cycle. Stress or anxiety is one of the main triggers for alopecia areata, but already having it causes more than enough stress, leading to more and more hair loss. It is a never-ending cycle that I have now accepted, but it is still very hard to deal with. Having the stress whether or not people are going to notice my hair thinning or if my hair blows in the wind and exposes my patches in public or wrapping my hand around my hair to feel that it has gotten thinner in the past few weeks or associating an everyday activity of brushing my hair with fear, just to see a handful of strands laying on my hand, no longer my head, which happens way too often to this day, and I just wonder, will there be a time where there's literally nothing left to lose? In these very moments, each lost strand feels more than a piece of hair; it feels like a piece of my spirit just slipping away, my confidence slipping away, and my happiness slipping away. Instead, doubt and anxiety come rushing in in place of those, which can be a very dark and unhealthy habit, because I am setting myself up for this emotional cycle to happen all over again.

Even though there is no cure, there are treatments for it, most of them being expensive. The first treatment I received was injections in the scalp. I know that sounds daunting, and it was at first. I could not accept the fact that I had to get at least 5 injections per patch, depending on the size, but I had to do it. The dermatologist referred me to an alopecia specialist, where we tried other treatments, such as topical and oral treatments. Once my body started to get used to those, I began laser treatments, which were 2-3 times a week, and very expensive. Luckily, at the time, my insurance covered it. My hair responded very well to this treatment, along with the others, as I had little to no patches and was on top of my routine. It wasn't until my insurance stopped covering it. They deemed laser treatments for cosmetic use. How could they say that? It's more than just hair; it's mental health, my dignity, how I present myself to the world. Yet, the system carelessly labels it as "cosmetic" as if having that constant pain of watching yourself disappear strand by strand isn't enough. Luckily for me, my dad stepped in without any hesitation, paying for my treatments out of pocket. I could and still cannot thank him enough, as I am forever grateful, and to this day, he still pays for all of my treatments. He didn't just financially support me; he gave me a lifeline and constantly reminded me that we were fighting this together, and I was never alone in this journey.

My dad has always been there for me since the second he noticed the thinning. After the diagnosis, he spent all of his time researching the disease to try to get a better understanding of how it is triggered and how we can prevent it from getting worse. Since stress is the number one trigger, he would meditate with me, even when I didn't want to, just to calm my nervous system down to slow down any potential patches from showing up. He would look up natural home remedies that miraculously grew back people's hair, and we would always try them out. Whatever hair oil he read about, he would always buy it on Amazon, and it would arrive the next day. Any chance he saw that could potentially help me, he always went for it. Any chance he got to take any stress or burden off my shoulders, he did without any hesitation. He would comb my hair with such ease, apply any treatment effectively, and keep up with my overall progress. I remember after the diagnosis, he suggested that I part my hair to the side to avoid people from seeing my thinning, but he did not make that obvious to me at 10 years of age that that was the reason. He did not want to be the reason that I was uncomfortable in my skin. Instead, he would take different routes, routes that made me feel empowered and protected my innocence. He never made me feel like something was wrong with me. He made simple adjustments that let me hold onto my confidence, even when I didn't know I needed it during my prime adolescence. If he could carry all of my stress, he would, and he still tries to. Even to this day, at 21 years old, he still holds my hands when i receive my treatments, wiping every single tear off my face, the tears that come pouring out of my eyes every time i sit in that exact chair, each time, constantly reminding me of the pain, fearm and the helplessness that may still linger. But in those very moments, his presence brings me back to reality and softens it all. He reminds me that I am never alone, and we are in this together forever. As cliche as it sounds, it really pushes me to persevere. He still looks up holistic remedies, sends me links, reads every product label, and ensures that I am consistent. He still does everything in his power, and I truly mean everything, to make sure I'm never facing this alone. We have built a truly incomparable bond, one rooted in faith, patience, and unconditional love. We became a team who have built a story that is one of a kind.

I saw what my dad did for me, that lifeline and friend that I didn't know I needed during one of the hardest and most confusing times in my life, and I want to do the exact same for others. I want to offer that same comfort and strength to kids who are going through their battles. I know how isolating it can feel to go through battles while trying to seem "okay" on the outside, and putting a fake, meaningless smile on your face to avoid any attention. I know how hard it can be to ask for any help or to be vulnerable, especially when you're not sure if anyone would understand. That's why I want to be the person who steps in quietly but meaningfully. I want to reiterate that they are not alone through whatever they are dealing with, which gives them an even bigger reason to persevere and not hide behind a fake smile. Sometimes, all it takes is one person who sees you, shows up, and reminds you that you're not broken, you're becoming. I want to be that person for someone else.

Through my journey, I realized the importance of building a connection in order to prompt healing. When someone feels understood and supported, even the worst times feel so much more uplifting. That's the impact my father had on me, and that is the impact I hope to have on someone else. Being a mentor isn't about giving advice; it is about having that constant, fulfilling presence, the type of presence that reminds someone that they have the power to keep going, which all comes from within.

My main goal as part of this team is to be that compassionate and consistent presence in a young person's life. I want to create a safe space where they know they feel seen, heard, and valued the way they are. With me, they will know their story holds purpose, power, and they will never be alone. They will see this power unravel from within right in front of their eyes. Our minds hold this great power, and once you firmly believe an outcome, your brain will always find a way to achieve that outcome. Our thoughts shape our reality, and I want to help these kids recognize the power they hold within their minds. I want to encourage them to trust in themselves and their ability to heal. Believe in the impossible, even when times are overwhelming. If I can help someone discover that strength and belief within, while reminding them they are never alone, then I'll know I've made a real impact.

What makes me feel alive is knowing that I've made someone feel seen, valued, and loved, even from afar. For several years now, my family and I have been St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital donors because we believe in the emotional healing that stems from knowing that others care and feel for you. Along with donations, we also send heartfelt messages filled with words of encouragement and affirmation to remind these children and their families that even people in the outside world are thinking of and supporting them, and I know that this feeling, knowing that you have people that genuinely cares for you and supports you every step of the way, carries the power to create a kind of healing that medicine alone can't always offer. Knowing that a small gesture can bring a moment of peace during a storm is what lights me up. That kind of love and care has the immense ability to restore hope and spirits, and even being a small part of that process is what truly makes me feel alive.
