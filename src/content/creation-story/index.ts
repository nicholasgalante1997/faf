## **A Life Rewritten \- A Foundation Dedicated to and Inspired by Jake and Sandi Frank**

### ***From One in a Billion to All for One***

---

### **Prologue**

There are things in this life that only the soul can understand, things no textbook, no doctor, no conversation can explain. To survive what should have ended you. To walk out of hell with your heart still beating. To become the person you once needed. This isn't just my story, it's a life rewritten, in service of others. A love letter to the miracle of survival, the pain that shaped me, and the purpose that now defines me.

### **Dedication**

To the ones quietly fighting battles no one sees.  
To the child who just heard the word “cancer.”  
To the parent pretending to be brave.  
To the soul screaming in silence.  
To the ones we lost, and the ones still holding on.  
You are not alone.  
We are Friends Already.

The odds of surviving what I endured? One in a billion.

By age twelve, I had lived through two separate pediatric cancers. The chance of both of mine happening specifically is so rare, it's almost impossible to measure.  
Rarer than being struck by lightning twice on the same day.

Cancer didn't just challenge my body, it dismantled who I thought I was. It stripped me down to the rawest version of myself, then asked me to rebuild with no instruction manual. Twice.

And yet, somehow, in that fire, I was forged.

I don't wear the scars to show off strength, I wear them because they are mine. Because they remind me I am living proof of what it means to keep going when everything says stop. And because surviving, I've learned, is not the finish line. It's the beginning.

A beginning forged by the strength of knowing that my hell was not written in my DNA. It was not in my genetic code. It was not something I could pass down. This was my battle, mine alone, and not one my children will ever be more likely to face. That truth became a beacon in the darkest moments. It told me that the chain ends here. That what nearly destroyed me will not touch them. And knowing that didn't just give me strength, it showed me that luck is relative, and something to be grateful for.

### **II. The Shift**

Something changes in you after you survive what could've killed you.

You stop asking, *“What do I want from life?”* and start asking,  
*“What does life want from me?”*

You start waking up with a different kind of urgency. Not the pressure to be productive, but the calling to be present. To serve. To mean something. To *mean everything* to someone who needs exactly who you've become.

There's a moment I'll never forget. Middle of the night. IV in my arm. Beeping machines. The sterile smell of a hospital that feels more like a prison. And I remember thinking, not “Will I make it?” but “If I do… *What will I do with this?*”

And that's the moment this all began.  
That was the seed of the Friends Already Foundation.  
The moment I realized that the greatest honor of my survival would be to *spend the rest of my life showing up for someone else*.

### **III. We're Friends Already**

People think the worst part of suffering is the pain. It's not.  
It's loneliness.

The silence in your phone when no one knows what to say.  
The feeling that you are somehow now “other.” That you make people uncomfortable.  
The aching need to feel *understood*.

That's why I created Friends Already.

Not as a charity. Not as an organization.  
As a *promise*.

A promise that no one would have to walk through it alone. That no one would have to earn love, or explain their pain to receive compassion. That the second someone connects with us, they don't need to audition for care. They're not a client, not a case, not a project.

They're Friends Already.

I built this from scratch, I designed every piece: the logo, the messaging, the recruitment. Every fiber of it was born from the soul of someone who lived it. I have recruited many, and continue to recruit, people who understand what it means to walk through fire and then choose to turn back and walk in for someone else. Not because they have to, but because they can.

### **IV. The Mission**

This is bigger than any battle.  
This is about connection.  
Because connection *is* the cure.

We don't wait until someone's at their breaking point to care.  
We don't see people as problems to fix, but as people to stand beside.  
We don't rescue, we *remember*.  
We remember what it felt like to need a hand and find none.  
We remember how one voice, one message, one friend changed everything.

We are here for those fighting illness and trauma.  
We are here for the families losing sleep.  
We are here for the kids, the parents, the siblings, the caretakers.  
We are here for *you*, even if you don't know how to ask.

This is what it means to *live for others*.  
This is what it means to turn pain into purpose.  
This is what it means to say, without hesitation:  
*We're Friends Already.*

### **V. Every Day Is a New Day**

There's something else I've learned, the hard way.

Every day is a new day.

That's not just a cliché. It's a truth that saved me.  
You don't have to be who you were yesterday.  
You don't have to carry what you've carried forever.  
You can start over. Right now.  
A new you. A new chance. A new opportunity to do good.  
To *be good*. To be someone's light.

Some days, all I did was survive.  
Some days, all I had was breath.  
But if you stack those days, one after another, you get a life.  
And if you give that life to something bigger than yourself…  
you get *meaning*.

---

### **VI. The Legacy**

I was given another shot at life. Most people don't get that.

So I'm spending it *building something that outlives me*.

A foundation made of hearts, not bricks.  
Of people who say “me too” before you even speak.  
Of kindness that doesn't ask for anything in return.  
Of mentors, friends, listeners, and fighters.  
Of pain transformed into presence.  
Of silence broken by the sound of *belonging*.

I don't want a monument.  
I want a movement.  
I want people to see this and say, *“Maybe I'm not so alone after all.”*

---

### **Epilogue**

I'm still here. Not just alive, but *awake*.

And if you're reading this, so are you.

We don't have to be perfect.  
We just have to be present.  
To choose love over indifference.  
To offer hands when others offer silence.  
To become the person we once needed.  
To make sure no one feels like a burden again.

And it starts with a single message:

**You don't have to explain yourself.**  
**You don't have to prove your worth.**  
**You don't have to fight alone.**  
**We're Friends Already.**
